# Lucid-Chart Vs Visio
Lucidchart is the best alternative to Visio.
Lucidchart is web based, where as Visio is not web based.
Lucid chart supports for freelancers, small business, Mid-size Business and Enterprise customers. Visio supports small business and Mid-size Business customers only.
We can integrate Lucid chart with Bitium, Box, Google Drive, HipChat, JIRA Software and Slack. Visio cannot be integrated with any apps.

# Lucid-Chart Vs draw.io
LucidChart was User friendly and Draw.io was not User friendly.

LucidChart auto saves the Diagram, but in Draw.io we have to save the diagram manually by clicking on save, then only we can able to see the changes.
In LucidChart no versions of Diagram for every new user, where as in Draw.io creates a new version of diagram. Then it will be difficult to identify the Original/Final Diagram in Draw.io.
In LucidChart no AWS 3D shapes are there. In Draw.io AWS 3D shapes are available.
In LucidChart for every blank diagram, we need to add AWS shapes. In Draw.io for every blank diagram no need to add AWS shapes, all the shapes are automatically added.
In LucidChart no need to create JIRA ticket first, we can start drawing the diagram and meanwhile scrum master/Reporter can create for us.  But in Drwa.io need to create JIRA ticket first, then only we can start drawing the diagram.
In LucidChart we can share the diagram, but in Draw.io we can't share the diagram.
In LucidChart we can drag/insert images from our system. In Draw.io	we can drag/insert images from our system, but sometimes image was blur.
